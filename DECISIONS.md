## DEC-001: Integer/Float Equivalence in LLM Number Validation

**Date:** 2026-01-24

**Decision:** When validating LLM output numbers against input numeric_summary, treat whole-number floats as equivalent to their integer representation.

**Rule:** `5.0` in input allows both `"5"` and `"5.0"` in output.

**Alternatives considered:**
1. Strict string matching only (`"5.0"` must appear as `"5.0"`)
2. Normalize all to floats before comparison
3. Allow any numeric equivalence (rejected: too permissive)

**Rationale:**
- LLMs naturally output `"5"` when the value is a whole number, even if input was `5.0`
- Strict matching causes false-positive validation failures
- Whole-number equivalence is mathematically sound and human-intuitive
- Non-whole numbers (e.g., `5.123`) still require exact string match

**Impact:**
- `LLMExplainOutputValidator` must implement whole-number equivalence check
- Tests in `test_llm_float_edge_cases.py` cover edge cases
- No security implications (still prevents LLM from inventing new numbers)
