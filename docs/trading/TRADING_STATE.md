**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** 2026-01-29  

## Milestones
- M0: Docs hardening + SSOT gates (current)

- M3: Live execution safety layer (separate decision)

## Done
- None (docs pack initialized)

## In progress
- Docs hardening (split monolith into SSOT docs)
- Root-level DEC/PRD/BINANCE_LIMITS/DATA_CONTRACTS/CHANGELOG updates (required before Phase 1)

## Known issues
